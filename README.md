# Agentic AI Travel Planning Assistant

## Project Objective
To design and implement an agentic AI-based travel planning assistant using Groq (LLaMA-3) and LangChain that generates personalized, end-to-end travel itineraries. The system integrates flight selection, hotel recommendation, place discovery, weather forecasting, and budget estimation through tool-based reasoning.

## Key Features
- Agent-based reasoning using LangChain
- Groq (LLaMA-3) as the LLM backend
- Modular tools for flights, hotels, places, weather, and budget
- Structured JSON and human-readable itinerary output
- Interactive Streamlit user interface

## Data Sources
- `flights.json` – flight details (price, duration, timings)
- `hotels.json` – hotel information (price, rating, location)
- `places.json` – tourist attractions and activities
- Open-Meteo API – real-time weather forecasts

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Groq (LLaMA-3)
- LangChain
- Streamlit
- Open-Meteo API
- JSON-based datasets
